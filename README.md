## Project Overview
This project involved building a Pirate Intelligent Agent to navigate an 8×8 maze using reinforcement learning. The overall goal was to setup the environment and generate the loop logic for the basic Q-network structure so that the agent was able to optimally and successfully reach the end of the maze. This logic incldues the full deep Q-learning algorithm, including action selection (epsilon-greedy), reward handling, the memory updates, and the model training.

## Work Completed
Provided: Environment, replay buffer, general Q-network framework.
Created: Training loop, action logic, replay sampling, Q-value updates, and model optimization.

## Computer Science Work and Why it Matters
This project showed how computer science is about designing intelligent, scalable and optimal solutions. Building an agent that learns from experience connects concepts like machine learning, optimization, and problem-solving into real world applications that could be used across many industries.

## Problem-Solving Approach
I broke the problem into parts—starting with understanding the environment, then coding and testing the training loop piece by piece within jupyter notebook.

## Ethical Responsibilities
It's important that computer scientists design systems that are safe, unbiased and ethical. Developers should have privacy, fairness, and transparency in mind throughout the entire process, from brainstorming, development, testing and maintenance. These values and ethics must always be prioritized for a valuable and trustworthy product and/or service.
